# http-lib-ajax-callbacks
This project was used to practice making a custom HTTP library. 

## Front-end
There are no UI components other than the heading. The app will call (https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/users) on the page refresh, depending on which RESTful call is active (not commented out). The first app files were written with pre-ES6 JS using HTTP prototype methods then converted to ES6 using arrow functions. And once more, converted to async/ await functions.

## Live Server
VS Code extension was added. The server is launched for the index.html page and will auto-refresh on each save.
